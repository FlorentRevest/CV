CV
==

This repository contains the LaTeX source code of my CV and motivation letters.

It uses the popular "moderncv" package but defines a slightly modified theme
called "classy", based on a mix of the default themes "classic" and "banking".

The CV source code can be found in the cv.tex file, and a motivation letter
template can be found in motivation.tex.

One can compile those files by installing the "texlive-xetex" package and
running "xelatex cv.tex" or "xelatex motivation.tex".
